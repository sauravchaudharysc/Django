Sure! Here's a properly formatted README for Django, encapsulated within a black box for easy copying:

# Django

Django is a Python web development framework. It handles everything that happens on the server (remote computer) that accepts incoming requests and sends responses, running the entire business logic. A framework is a module (third-party library) that provides a bunch of utility functions, so a developer doesn't need to focus on the nitty-gritty details. Django is built for Python 3.x and follows a "batteries included" approach, offering built-in solutions and features for almost all problems.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new Django project, use the following command:

```sh
django-admin startproject FolderName
```

## IDE

- **Visual Studio Code** (Extensions: Python, Pylance)

## Django Project Structure

Django projects follow a modular structure consisting of multiple modules called apps. To add different features to a project, you need to add multiple apps. A website is an entire project, and the features of the website are called apps.

To create a new app, use the following command:

```sh
python3 manage.py startapp challenges
```

## URLs (or Routes) & Views

- **URLs**: Define the URLs that the project will support.
- **Views**: Functions or classes executed for different URLs, containing code that handles (evaluates) requests and responses.

Various URLs redirect to different pages. URL-Action mappings ensure that certain results are achieved when specific URLs are entered by the user.

## Understanding Requests & Responses

Django handles delivering content and processing input through a request-response cycle.
